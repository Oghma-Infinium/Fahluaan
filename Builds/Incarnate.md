# Incarnate

> "Molag Bal wanted my mind, Boethiah wanted my arms, and Nocturnal perhaps my curiosity. Azura wants all of that, and our love above all. Not our abject slavering, but our honest and genuine caring in all its forms. It is important to her that our emotions be engaged in her worship. And our love must also be directed inward. If we love her and hate ourselves, she feels our pain. I will, for all time, have no other mistress." â€” Sigillah Parate, [*Invocation of Azura*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Invocation_of_Azura)

## Inspiration

This is the first of my daedra themed builds. I will write more later probably.

**Standing Stone**: Mage Stone early game, swap to Lady
