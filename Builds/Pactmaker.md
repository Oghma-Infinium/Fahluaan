> "Who can say what drives some of our blessed people to abandon their faith and take up with heretical gods? Greed, I suppose, is a motivating factor, as well as anger, jealousy, and the search for something better. A few, I can accept, are true believers, misguided though they might be. Most, I suspect, are duped fools chasing after whatever promises are laid before them." â€” Ordinator Alurua, [*The Nycotic Cult*](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Nycotic_Cult)

## Roleplay Inspiration

WIP

## Character Overview

**Race**: Imperial or Breton. Both are sensible RP choices and offer good buffs throughout your playthrough. 
	
**Class**: There is no definitive class choice, any defensive class (Knight, Battlemage, Sorcerer) are good. Any utility class (Acrobat, Bard, Pilgrim) can be very competitive on this build. 
 
**Standing Stone**: Mage or Lady Stone early game, swap to Steed Stone once you get Zealot perk.

**Religion**: Clavicus Vile (Buying and selling prices are 10/20% better. / Scrolls are 50% stronger, and you find scrolls much more often, but your Magicka is permanently depleted.)

**Transformation**: N/A

**Archetype**: Spellsword

**Stat Split**: 1/2/1 (Health/Magicka/Stamina) until level 20. After level 20 2/0/1. Prioritize getting Zealot as close to level 20 as possible.
> Level 20 Stat Split (before buffs): 150 H : 200 M : 150 S  
> Level 50 Stat Split (before buffs): 350 H : 200 M : 250 S  
> Level 50 Stat Split (after buffs):  500 H : 200 M : 250 S  (+25 All attributes as Imperial)

## Min-Maxing Stuff

 - Leverage Alcohol (Mead) as taking a hit to your Magicka isn't actually an issue once you have Zealot.
 - If you want to spend less levels into Magicka prior to getting Zealot, then you can try to rely on
 > Alcohol (Wine): 25/50 Magicka, -25/50 Stamina  
 > Flute: 25/50 Magicka  
 > Amulet of Julianos/Jyrik's Amulet Fragment: 25/50 Magicka   
 > Julianos (or Azura once you have Cultist rank 1): 25/50 Magicka  
 > Total: +100/+200 Magicka, -25/50 Stamina
 - The reason the above advice wasn't included outside of this section is because you don't really need more attributes that what you are getting by level 50 with the standard stat split.
 - Masque of Clavicus Vile is included for the fact I want these builds to utilize the artifact of the Daedric Prince. There are arguably better choices for helmets, but since this build has no need for Spell Cost Reduction buffs, the value of a Head slot falls in terms of opportunity cost. Since the build is a tanky spellsword, Reflect can be nice for some extra damage and Fortify Barter is useful for just general economy management.
