## Initial Setup

Before reading this guide, please follow the [readme](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Fahluaan/blob/main/README.md) as it will answer the vast majority of technical questions related to getting the list setup and running. Be sure to check out the [configuration](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Fahluaan/blob/main/Documentation/CONFIG.md) page to learn more about the optional tweaks and addons and MCM options.

## Basics

This section will cover the absolute basics of the list. I suggest reading, or skimming all of the linked mod pages in this section if you are unfamiliar with the preceding mods.

Before reading this section, I suggest looking over the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/fahluaan) and [keybinds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Fahluaan/blob/main/images/Keybinds.png) or [gamepad binds](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Fahluaan/blob/main/images/Gamepad.png). 

### Core Mods

 - [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) and [Hand to Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) handle the perks in the list. Some edits have been made to the perks to ensure cleaner "compatibility" with the rest of the list, they can be read about [here](#perk-tweaks).
 - [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) and [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) handle races and standing stones respectively. Some race changes have been made, read more [here](#race-tweaks).
 - [Aptitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96034) provides 21 classic Elder Scrolls classes to choose from, providing an initial boost to your character.
 - [Manbeast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746) and [Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639) handle werewolves and vampires.
 - [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) handles Religion as a mechanic, some changes have been made to the mod and can be read about [here](#religion-tweaks).
 - [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) handles the overarching "rules" for combat and makes changes to the resource management systems. 
 - [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536) makes extensive changes to the way Survival Mode is implemented and functions. Survival Mode is enabled by default, but can be disabled at any time in the in-game Settings menu.
 - I also suggest getting acquainted with the [Wheeler - Quick Action Wheel of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345) mod. The page provides significant documentation on how to set it up and use the mod. 
   > The default keybinds to bring up the wheel are `Q` for Keyboard and `X` or `Square` for Controller. You can edit these keybinds (and other aspects of the wheel) in the [dMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97221) GUI, which can be opened with the `Home` button on your keyboard.
 - A custom edit of [Skyrim Unbound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) comprises the alternate start for the list. Please use the MCM to select starting gear, spells, standing stone, and starting location. Chapter II and Chapter III will take you to select a starting deity.

### Leveling and Progression

Fahluaan modifies the vanilla leveling experience in a way to reward the player for engaging in the world in sensible ways. While perks can be obtained through leveling, the perks gained from leveling alone are unlikely to be sufficient for sustaining a full character build in late game. Below is a general breakdown of what to expect with the leveling and progression system in Fahluaan.

#### Changes to leveling

 - Skill experience starts slow, peaks in mid-game, and then returns to a slower pace. However, there are many sources to boost your leveling speed.
   - Akatosh, Tall Papa, and Jephre both give experience as a shrine bonus.
   - Sleep and Food will both give varying tiers of experience boosts.
   - [The Gift of Charity](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Gift_of_Charity) now gives 5% experience for 30 minutes instead of Fortify Persuasion for 1 hour.
   - [Ancient Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Powers#Ancient_Knowledge) gives a permanent 20% experience gain to crafting skills.
   - Gift of Gab gives a permanent 10% experience gain to all skills.
   - Skill books provide a permanent boost to leveling speed in their respective skill, instead of giving a level. This effect is boosted by the Scholar's Insight Black Book power. 
 - Leveling up requires sleeping in a bed. This is done to incentivize "good behavior".
 - Perks can also be obtained through the following:
   - **Quests**: The following quests will grant 1 perk point on completion: (23 total). 
     - [Diplomatic Immunity](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Diplomatic_Immunity)
     - [The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Horn_of_Jurgen_Windcaller)
     - [Alduin's Wall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alduin%27s_Wall)

     - [Revealing the Unseen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Revealing_the_Unseen)
     - [The Eye of Magnus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Eye_of_Magnus)
     - [Darkness Returns](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Darkness_Returns)
     - [Under New Management](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Under_New_Management)
     - [Bound Until Death](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bound_Until_Death)
     - [Hail Sithis!](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hail_Sithis!)
     - [Tending the Flames](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Tending_the_Flames)
     - [Beyond Death](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Beyond_Death)
     - [Kindred Judgement](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kindred_Judgment)
     - [Lost to the Ages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lost_to_the_Ages)
     - [The Temple of Miraak](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Temple_of_Miraak)
     - [The Path of Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Path_of_Knowledge)
     - [At the Summit of Apocrypha](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:At_the_Summit_of_Apocrypha)
     - [Barrow of the Wyrm](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Barrow_of_the_Wyrm)
     - [Someone with Backbone](https://tes-mods.fandom.com/wiki/Someone_with_Backbone)
   - The [Oghma Infinium](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Oghma_Infinium) grants **3** perks on use.
   - [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849), [Glenmoril](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32998), and [Unslaad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789) add their own systems through which perks can be obtained, however these systems are not considered when balancing availability of perks, and it is generally suggested to avoid these systems for balancing purposes.
 - The first level up, level 2, gives bonus stats (20 Health, Magicka, or Stamina rather than the usual 10). You will gain a total of 500 attributes by level 50 and 1000 attributes by level 100.
 - There are 54 perks to accumulate through leveling by level 50, it is expected that an additional 15 to 20 are obtained via alternative sources.
 - Leveling up does not increase carry weight. This is done to make carry weight buffs feel worthwhile. 
 - Survival Mode gives no penalty to carry weight.
 - Training is slightly cheaper and you can train up to 10 times per level.

## Tips and Help

Due to Fahluaan being a very build-oriented list that rewards proper preparation and varying degrees of min-maxing, newer players may have a difficult time starting out or may feel overwhelmed and uncertain with how they want to build their characters. This section will contain varying community tips and build guides to be expanded over time.
 - The [Fahluaan Build Spreadsheet](https://tinyurl.com/fahluaanbuilds) can be a great place to start out for those looking for a general idea of a character to play.
