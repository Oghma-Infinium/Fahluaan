**This page is currently unfinished, I'll work on it as I find motivation to.**

This document is mostly so I have somewhere to document the Unique Sets in Fahluaan. Set Bonuses only factor in the four pieces of armor (Head, Chest, Hands, Feet), they do not count in accessory gear, like shields or weapons.

Unenchanted variations of every set (except Oli'Dar) can be crafted if you have the chest piece of the set in your inventory (and the appropriate crafting perks).
