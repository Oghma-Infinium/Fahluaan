## FAQ

### Q: Why does my game freeze after every load transition?
A: It's not freezing, the list has a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60958) that pauses the game after cell transitions.

### Q: What mod is it that makes favorited items/potions/quest items show on my character?
A: [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001). You can open the menu with `Backspace` to customize what you want to show and what you don't want to show. You can also use IED to determine weapon positioning (if you want weapons to be sheathed on back for example).

### Q: I can't level up, what do I do?  
A: You need to sleep in a bed in order to level up. If you do not want to be forced to sleep in a bed, then you may change this option in the Survival Mode Control Panel MCM.

### Q: I leveled up but didn't get any perk points. / How do I get perk points?
A: [RTFM](https://github.com/Oghma-Infinium/Fahluaan/blob/main/GAMEPLAY.md).

### Q: How do I start the main questline?  
A: If you have chosen to be Dragonborn in the Skyrim Unbound MCM, then upon killing your first dragon, you will be summoned by the Greybeards. If you have chosen to not be the Dragonborn, then you can not proceed with the main questline, doing so will also lock you out of a fair amount of content in the list due to the way quest progression is setup.

### Q: When do dragons start spawning?  
A: By default, dragons are set to be delayed in their spawns from 7 to 21 days after you leave the starting room. By default, dragons will **NOT** spawn in the wild, so you will have to hunt them at their Word Walls.

### Q: Why did the dragon I kill not give me a Dragon Soul?
A: Was the dragon by Valtheim Towers? Was its name Wuthahrkgolah? This dragon is a friendly NPC from the Citizens of Tamriel mod, and was not designed to be killed by the player. It doesn't give a Dragon Soul.

### Q: How do I become the Thane of Whiterun?   
A: You must complete [The Blessings of Nature](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Blessings_of_Nature) quest and talk to Jarl Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired/the sappling blooms. He'll thank you and allow you to buy the Breezehome, and the standard thaneship quest (help people of the hold and buy a house to become a thane) will be available.

### Q: I finished The Blessing of Nature, how long does the tree take to bloom?
A: It can take a few in-game days to a few in-game weeks. You can wait these out if you'd like, but make sure to do so away from Whiterun.

### Q: I can't find Altano in the Windpeak Inn. / How do I start VIGILANT?  
A: VIGILANT requires the player be level 25, completion of House of Horrors, and completion of Kindred Judgement (the final quest of Dawnguard DLC). 
> Similarly, GLENMORIL and UNSLAAD require certain quests to be completed in order to be played. GLENMORIL requires Vigilant, At the Summit of Apocrypha (the final quest of the Dragonborn DLC), and Sacred Anatomancer (a quest from Vigilant that can be started in the Ratway) to be completed. 
> UNSLAAD requires the completion of GLENMORIL and Dragonslayer (the final quest of the Main Questline).

### Q: Why won't Lucien talk to me?
A: You selected They/Them pronouns. Go into the Pronouns MCM, select She/Her or He/Him, then speak to Lucien again. After you have gotten him as a follower, you are free to switch back to They/Them.

### Q: Why won't Kodlak talk to me when I am trying to join the companions?
A: You selected They/Them pronouns. Go into the Pronouns MCM, select She/Her or He/Him, then speak to Kodlak again. After you have gotten him as a follower, you are free to switch back to They/Them.

### Q: How do I get rid of the black bars? How to disable letterbox.
A: Open the ENB Menu (Default `Shift+Enter`), Open `ENBPOSTPASS.FX`, Scroll down until you see "letterbox" and untick it, Press the "Save Configuration" button, Close the ENB Menu.

### Q: Sex?
A: No.

## Known Issues

### [Insert NPC] is naked despite having armor in their inventory!
Solution(s)
 1. Currently there is no known solution to this as it is a non-reproducible issue with [SPID's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) outfit distribution method from version 6.5 onwards. Unfortunately, the newer versions of SPID have added some much needed functions utilized by other mods, so while this issue is rare, it's entirely unavoidable.

### Being randomly attacked or arrested by NPCs!
Solution(s)
 1. open the console, select one of the NPCs, and type `paycrimegold 0 0`

### Can't start the Forsworn Conspiracy Quest / Kibell doesn't have the dialogue to initiate the Forsworn Conspiracy!
Solution(s)
 1. Open the console and type `set ANDR_MS01_Ready to 1` and then enter Markarth between the hours of 8am and 8pm and the scene between Weylin and Margaret should play out, allowing you to start the quest normally.

### [Insert Issue with the Civil War]
Solution(s)
 1. The civil war is broken in vanilla. I generally suggest not doing it.
 2. Fast traveling after battles can cause issues as the game tends to get stuck in a perpetually battle state.

### [Insert Issue related to gamepad]
Solution(s)
 1. Make sure to delete the Control map in the Stock Game folder.

### Body type won't change when trying to apply a new body through OBody.
Solution(s)
 1. This is an issue with Engine Fixes/RaceMenu. The safest workaround is to change obody preset, equip and unequip the chestpiece, and the body type should change.
 2. Restart the Game/Your PC and try again.
 3. Read [FAQ 9](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016?) on the OBody modpage.
