## 1.3.4

Info

 - Fixed Shrine of Azura Summer SWAP.
 - Fixed unenchanted double stave issue.
 - Patched Shrine of Hircine in the midden to give the appropriate Pilgrim buff.
 - The Watcher in the midden depths now gives an actual shrine buff.
 - Nerfed Clavicus Vile to bring Scroll builds more inline with other builds in terms of end-game damage output. They are still the highest DPE builds possible by a solid margin.

 - (Potentially) Fixed werewolf texture issue.
 - Rebalanced Afflicted Vile Vapors Ability to better reflect other poison spells and abilities.
 - Shield spells (Master level shell spells) buffed from 75% Resist to 100% Resist (75% resist is still cap). This change is made to allow certain builds to better offset certain debuffs they may have to take.
 - Consistency patched the potions and ingredients added by OCW to use proper Apothecary effects.
 - Sovereign Band now gives +50% Conjuration Duration instead of +50% Magicka Regen.
 - Removed Renewal Perk from Dragon Priests.

## 1.3.0

Info
 
 - Conflict check over the entire list, cleaned up (a lot of) errors.
 - Unslaad 3.0 Update.
 - Seasons of Skyrim Added.
 - Added Journeyman back as an opt-in mod.
 - Regenerated Sorcerer and Khajiit Speak patches.
 - Fixed Night Eye (maybe).
 - Fixed body texture misalignment on beast races.
 - Fixed Hagraven Clutter missing textures.
 - Fixed issue where Helm of the Deep Diver wasn't appropriately patched for Open Face Helmets.
 - Fixed Gladiator's Sword not dealing the proper amount of Bleed Damage.
 - Fixed Clockwork Cuirass missing its enchant.
 - Tweaked the Clockwork set.
 - Reworked Gladiator Set.
 - Changed the Ravager's Set.
 - Changed the bonus for the Paradise set.
 - Followers no longer affect the stealth meter.
 - Slightly rebalanced economy.
 - Added the Unbound Room to the Oblivion Cell formlist so survival needs shouldn't progress until you leave.
 - Bow speeds are now standardized (most were previously, but all should be covered now). Unique items with faster draw (like Zephyr) are excluded.
 - Nerfed scroll crafting xp.
 - Adjusted overall XP curve for some skills.
 - Bound Weapons now give Conjuration experience when used. This is to compensate for how slowly bound weapon builds level if they are not using summons to supplement their conjuration leveling.
 - Unique sets can be recrafted as unenchanted gear if you have the appropriate perks and the cuirass of the set in your inventory.

 - Cleaned out some unused downloads from early development.

 - Added light variants of the Volkihar Knight armor to be crafted. They require Glass Smithing and completion of Dawnguard.
 - Fixed invisible meshes on some unique items (this might have only been a pre-release issue).
 - The Spell Absorb visual was removed, due to more enemy types having spell absorb now and the visual being very annoying and triggering too often in some cases. The player will still be alerted that enemies "resisted" a spell when absorption occurs.
 - Player is no longer randomly assigned an OBody preset in racemenu.

## 1.2.4

Sorry, ***this** is the last update. Save in an interior before updating. For those who do not want to upload again, just download the new DynDOLOD and Occlusion Output files on the nexus page [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87820?tab=files) and overwrite the existing `Fahluaan - DynDOLOD Output` and `Fahluaan - Occlusion Output` mods.

 - Fixed a lod issue.
 - Styyx also fixed his mod which will hopefully fix some quest rewards I had previously setup, unfortunately this can't be applied retroactively to existing saves, but I promise you aren't missing out on much.
 - Reduced the number of favor quests needed to get thaneship. To fix this on existing games, use the following console commands `set FriendsTotalMajorHold to 10` and `set FriendsTotalMinorHold to 5`

<Details>

### Updated
 
 - DynDOLOD 3 Alpha
 - DynDOLOD DLL NG

</Details>

## 1.2.3

Save Safe.

 - I'll be away and unable to update the 8-14th, sorry for so many updates these past few days LOL.
 - New Unique set (Rakazra).
 - Removed errant enchants from some Moon Monk gear.
 - Buffed Ravager's Axe (unique item).
 - Rebalanced the Merchant perk in the Speech tree.
 - Changed Fighter's Stance, Warrior's Stance, and Brawler's Stance to be one rank perks. This should appropriately tune some power attack damage for both the player and NPCs.
 - Kematu now gives you the enchanted Remnant set if you side with him. You no longer have to kill him to get the armor.
 - Fixed a ton of tooltips on unique sets.
 - Fixed the Distinct Interior _SWAP.ini so it now properly swaps the statics with lootable items.
 - Reverted CoMAP's dll to version 3.4.2.

<Details>

 - Buffed Boethiah by reducing the Armor Rating debuff on the player from 300 to 200.
 - Fixed a crash due to bingus messing up some meshes she edited. Please disable the `Snazzy Strongboxes - Custom Meshes` and `Snazzy Safes - Custom Meshes` mods if you do not want to update.
 - Made an edit to the unique Raven set.

## 1.2.1

Hotfix, GIHB (god i hate bingus). Save Safe.

 - fixed dick void.

<Details>

### Updated
 
 - Starfrost - A Survival Overhaul

</Details>

## 1.2.0

### Info

Probably not save-safe. 90% not save-safe.

 - Survival Mode is enabled by default now. I decided to do this because it lets me have the more "hardcore" mechanics I want enabled by default while being easy to "opt-out" of instead of the intended experience for the list being "opt-in". Please read more about Survival Mode changes on the [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536) mod page as it is very different from base Survival.
 - Bingus made me do graphic stuff again.
 - Fixed Sunder's mesh *again*.
 - Tweaked Precision settings.
 - Removed CC Goblins, CC Plague of the Dead, and CC Bone Wolf.
 - Fixed Khajiit Racial not applying the Shock Resistance.
 - Archer class tooltip is more accurate now.
 - Fixed a tooltip on Raven's Shadow.
 - Regenerated most Synthesis patches.
 - Added a Shrine of Meridia to the start cell.
 - Changed the performance grass enb preset to be a more general, broader focused performance preset.
 - [Non-List] Migrated some documentation from the readme to a new document.

## 1.1.0

### Info

According to Simon this should be **Save Safe**. **Save in an interior before updating if you plan on continuing an existing save.**

 - Bingus made me do some graphic stuff. File size may have gone up or down, I have no idea.
 - Added Starfrost and Candlehearth to (I think) complete the Survival Lite suite. Survival is still optional, but it's much more in line with what I want from survival now.
 - Do not update while you have any rested buff.
 - While this update is save safe, if you aren't too far into your playthrough, I would restart just for safety.
 - Wheeler keybinds have been fixed a bit.
 - Wheeler now uses the same font as the rest of the main UI (Sanguis).
  - Changed Wheeler Menu controller keybinds to not default to Left Trigger, I still suggest playing around with these as a controller player since I do not have a controller and do not really know what works well for them.
    - Right Thumb to open in inventory, no bind to open outside of inventory.
    - DPAD Right/Left to move between items.
    - Check dMenu (`Home` to open) for the rest of the binds.
 - Fixed purple lods caused by IMR.
 - Sunder appropriately sheathes like a mace now.
 - Regenerated Khajiit Speak patch.
