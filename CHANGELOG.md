## 2.1.0

Key Info

 - Not Save-Safe.
 - Controversy Update. 
 - Many changes were made in order to make the list easier to be maintained in the long run, as well as maintaining a higher consistent quality.
 - Significant amount of file space optimization.
 - Reorganization of several mods in Mod Organizer and a sanity check on the visual section of the modlist.
 - Changes made to the Destruction tree's progression (which also bleed over into some progression changes for the Restoration tree). These changes are primarily intended to fix a discrepancy I saw between Melee skill progression and Magic skill progression.
 - Reworked Auriel and added two new perks for Sun spells. Auriel being the Sun spell deity makes sense in a traditional SimonRim environment, but makes less sense when religion is disconnected from the regular perk trees, so Sun spells now have an attached perk to make them usable on non-undead targets and Auriel was given a different buff as a result.
 - Added a disable Killmoves optional plugin. It is on by default.
 - Overhaul to inventory and wheeler icons thanks to Komegaki.

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

### Balancing Changes

 - Fixed the exploit where you could spam Courage-type Illusion spells in towns and inns to quickly farm Illusion skill. (A big thanks to [Simon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746) for giving me the method to implement this). 
 - Augmented Flames, Frost, Shock, and Raw Power perks changed to require level 20/60 Destruction (was 30/70).
 - Firebrand, North Wind, and Unstable Current perks changed to require level 40/90 Destruction (was 60/90).
 - Execution perk changed to require level 40/90 Destruction (was 80/100).
 - Aspection perk changed to require level 100 Destruction (was 60).
 - Rune Mage perk changed to require level 30/70 Destruction (was 30/60).
 - Spell Surge perk changed to require level 30 Destruction (was 20).
 - Spell Surge now reduces the cost of Dual Casting by 20% (was 25%).
 - Impact perk changed to require level 70 Destruction (was 40).
    - The changes to Spell Surge and Impact were done to fill the new gaps at level 30 and 70 perks (as Augment X moved to 20/60 for consistency with Melee Weapon Specialization perks) and in order to nerf Destruction mages because they vastly overperform at every stage of character progression. 
 - Added Elemental Veil perk. Requires 60 Destruction. Elemental Cloak spells are twice as strong.
 - Empowered Ward perk changed to require level 30 Restoration (was 20).
 - Divine Glory perk changed to require level 20/60 Restoration (was 30/70).
 - Affliction perk changed to require level 20/60 Restoration (was 30/70).
 - Dawn's Wrath perk changed to require level 30/70 Restoration (was 40/80).
 - Affliction perk changed to require level 40/90 Restoration (was 60/90).
 - Power of the Light perk changed to require level 40/90 Restoration (was 60/90).
 - Added Enduring Conviction perk. Requires 80 Restoration. Sun spells can now affect living, daedra, and automatron targets.
 - Added Sanctification perk. Requires 100 Restoration. Sun spells have a chance to smite targets when they fall below half Health.
 - Pilgrim of Auriel has been reworked to make Restoration Spells cost 20% less Magicka when dual cast. This change makes Restoration spells more cost efficient to dual cast than single cast (2.4x cost for 2.5x magnitude instead of 3.0x cost for 2.5x magnitude).
 - Dual Focus perk now reduces Stamina cost of Dual Power Attacks by 20% (was 25%).
 - Elemental Fury Meditation bonus now reduces the Stamina cost of power attacking and drawing a bow by 20% (was 25%).
 - Flourish perk now only applies while wielding a One-handed weapon with an empty left hand.
    - Finally, I have reimplemented a perk change from May 2023 that I kept forgetting to include in the list. Now doom can stop bothering me about it every update.
 - Flourish now increases attack speed by 20% (was 10%).
 - Removed additional instances of Curate's Armor since some mods add Ancient Falmer Armor but since it was referencing the vanilla record it was instead adding Artificer's Curate Armor.
 - Reduced the fine for the Alik'r Prisoner to 1500 gold (was 2500).
 - Removed Bandit Agents, Healers, Nightblades, and Witchhunters from generic bandit spawns. I feel as though these were not enemy classes that belonged to Bandits.
 - Bandit Spellswords no longer use bound weapons.
 - Removed Monk bosses from Solstheim Reaver lists.
 - Bandits no longer have North Wind or Plague-type perks as they were not intuitive and felt oppressive.
 - Nerfed Bandit Boss Combat Health regen to 0.5 Combat Health Regen Multiply (was 0.7). Removed the Fortify Heal Rate (was 0.15).
 - Vampire Thralls now pull their own level lists instead of bandit level lists. Witchhunters, Agents, and Spellswords will be seen in these enemy pools.
 - Removed Draugr Shamans from generic Draugr spawns.
 - Adjusted enemy spawns for Bleak Falls Barrow Exterior, Embershard Mine, and Silent Moons Camp (interior).
 - Companion's Helmet now increases Health by 20 (was 25).
 - Companion's Boots now increase Stamina Regeneration by 25% (was increase Stamina by 25).
 - Armor of the Companions is now disenchantable.
 - Stamina now regenerates 50% slower while casting a spell. 
 - Steed Stone now makes sprinting cost no Stamina while out of combat and increases Carry Weight by 100 (was +20% Movement Speed and +100 Carry Weight).
 - Lover Stone now also increases damage taken while casting a spell.
 - Bretons' major skill is now Alteration (was Conjuration).
 - Orcs' major skill is now Smithing (was Heavy Armor).
 - Agent class now also reduces the stamina cost of sneaking by 25%.
 - Acrobat class now also reduces the cost of sprinting by 50%.
 - Monk class now increases base unarmed damage by 5 points instead of by 25%. 
    - This is a 20% buff for Khajiit and Argonians (or Werewolves) and a 60% buff for all Human and Elf races at level 1. 
    - Flat unarmed damage is a much stronger way of implementing this buff and the previous iteration of Monk was a flat out less desirable choice than picking a class like Barbarian.
 - Eris will only appear in the Bannered Mare after level 5.
 - Removed 2 Spider Spawns before the Web Mother room in Bleak Falls Barrow.
 - Patrolling Stormcloak officers should no longer be carrying around full sets of enchanted Stormcloak Bear Armor.
 - Removed a bunch of Expert Spells from Wyrmstooth.
 - Reduced the amount of time AI spends searching for the player after being detected or attacked.
 - Reduced Arch-Mage Ritual quest requirement from 2 to 1.

### Bug Fixes
 
 - Fixed Windcaller (Stormcrown perk) unintentionally affecting Werewolf howls.
 - Fixed Aspen trees and Fall Forest Shrubes using the wrong seasonal swaps.
 - Fixed typo in `FlamesOfColdharbourAtroForge_FLM.ini` that made Coldfire spells impossible to craft at the Atronach Forge.
 - Removed Redguard Elite Helmet meshes from Bodyslide Output as they conflicted with the Open Helmets meshes, causing the mesh to not show up properly.
 - Fixed MO2 pathing several Season `.ini` files incorrectly.
 - Fixed Jyggalag shrine again.
 - "Fixed" the issue where Astrid's burnt body was more NSFW than intended.
 - Stair case in Valerica's Lab is no longer missing due to errant room bound.
 - Fixed Robes of the Lich missing textures on female characters (for real this time, I promise).
 - Fixed the Aetherial Staff becoming non-functional once the player reached level 40.
 - Fixed a significant amount of Spell Magic Effects that were being incorrectly overridden by an outdated patch. Because this list was long I will not go into extensive detail.
 - Fixed a couple of seasonal meshes I did not keep good enough documentation on to list here.
 - Fixed a bug where Spread the Love quest still required you to hand out 30 pamphlets instead of respecting the change made in 2.0.
 - Fixed an issue where Autumn Solstheim was incorrectly swapping Volcanic Ash terrain for summer variants in some areas.
 - Removed a floating piece of Moss near Tel Mithryn.
 - Fixed issue where Myrwatch was inaccessible due to some misplaced walls.
 - Fixed a shadow bug in Half Moon Mil.
 - Cooked Beef, Goat Roast, and Venison Chop will no longer show up in cooking pot inventory unless you have the required raw meat.
 - Fixed issue where you could wear some circlets with Dragon Priest Masks.
 - Fixed missing scroll crafting table in the Frozen Hearth.
 - Cultist of Nocturnal no longer breaks the perks Hidden Threat and Living Shadow.
 - Fixed `HagravenDeadSpriggan01` and `02` from having a shader bug when in Winter (I think).
 - Fixed an issue where the Bow of Shadows was not obtainable.

 - Potentially fixed a crash that occured when entering the Labyrinthian Tribune.
 - Potentially fixed random crash that happened when obody was attempting to apply a preset to certain NPCs.
 - Potentially fixed issue with Stormlord finery making the player's hands invisible when equipped. Thanks to discord user subhumantrash for providing the fix.

 - Stamina cost of sprinting was completely reimplemented. 
    - Sprinting costs 8 Stamina by default. 
    - Each piece of Light Armor increases the cost of sprinting by 0.5 Stamina. 
    - Each piece of Heavy Armor increases the cost of sprinting by 1 Stamina.

 - (Forsworn) Master spells are now only used by the final tier of bosses (Level 55/60).
 - (Forsworn) Forsworn Shamans can no longer buff Animal Familiars. Only Briarheart Shamans are able to do so.
 - (Forsworn) Summoning Familiars now has a large cooldown, so enemies will not be able to constantly resummon their allies if they are killed, but will be able to resummon if a fight drags on too long.
 - Removed the Merchant COIN exchange system, COIN currency will now automatically be converted into Septims upon looting. Might be a little less immersive but I think the gameplay of having to exchange all the coins was a bit redundant.
 - Redesigned enchantments on Chrysamere, Fists of Randagulf, Headsman's Cleaver, Ice Blade of the Monarch, Lord's Mail, Shadowrend, and Staff of Sheogorath (unobtainable but still).
 - Rebalanced the Werewolf’s innate level scaling, which includes bonuses to their unarmed damage, their bonuses to Health, Magicka, and Stamina, and their innate Armor Rating and Magic Resistance.
 - Added coverage for the four Werewolf artifacts. These artifacts work in both mortal form and in Werewolf form, and offer powerful stat bonuses to the Werewolf.
 - (Werewolf) The Ferocious Claws perk has been removed.
 - (Werewolf) A new perk, Bloody Claws, adds Bleeding damage to all your claw attacks. Bleeding damage is doubled on power attacks.
 - (Werewolf) Savage Strength now has a 25% chance to proc (instead of a 50% change); however, it no longer requires enemies to fall below half Health.
 - (Werewolf) The Feral Speed perk has been reduced from 25% to 20% to be more consistent with other Simonrim effects.
 - (Werewolf) The Howl of Rage now buffs Movement Speed by 20%, instead of 25%, to be more consistent with other Simonrim effects.
 - (Werewolf) Totem of the Bone now reduces incoming damage while power attacking by 50%.
 - (Werewolf) Totem of the Skin now causes your claw attacks to reduce enemy Armor Rating by 150.
 - Rebalanced the Vampire Lord’s innate level scaling, which includes the power of the Vampire Lord’s right hand Drain Life spell, their unarmed damage, their bonuses to Health, Magicka, and Stamina, and their innate Armor Rating and Magic Resistance.
 - Added coverage for the four Vampire artifacts. These artifacts work in both “mortal” form and in Vampire form.
 - Reduced the base magnitude of Devouring Claw, since it is affected by both Nightwalker and the “Blood Magic” perks.
 - (Vampire Lord) Set up Devouring Claw to work with False Life.
 - (Vampire Lord) The perk Unearthly Will now only increases Health and Magicka (you still get Stamina scaling based on level).
 - The Dark Elf vampire racial no longer increases the effectiveness of sneak by 25%. Instead, it reduces the cost of Vampiric spells by 25%. It still increases Sneak Attack damage by 25%.
 - The Imperial vampire racial no longer reduces the cost of Illusion spells by 25%. Instead, it now increases the duration of Illusion spells by 100% (up from 50%).
 - You will now be able to earn the Steam achievement for mastering Vampirism when you learn all 22 Vampire perks in Scion.
 - Adjusted crossbow weapon speed.
 - Edited level lists from [Heart of the Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76494) so that the highest level weapons would always drop from the forsworn bosses.
 - Edited forsworn and hagraven enemies added by [Heart of the Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76494) to be consistent with other forsworn enemies.

### Bug Fixes
 
 - Removed a duplicate Fixed Mesh Lighting download.
 - Removed alpha from `dlc02stalhrimoreouter_m.dds` due to texture bug it caused.
 - Removed Imperial Dragon Cloak and Storm-Bear Cloak from the Civil War Champion's container. These items were not intended to be acquirable.
 - Fixed a typo in `SoS_Seasonspatch_WIN.ini` that caused `RockTundraLand03Tundra01` to not be swapped.
 - Fixed a formatting error that caused the previous Apiary snow shader fix from version [1.4.2](#142) to never actually take effect.
 - Adjusted landscape near Cyrodil border so that Mirich Ran's chair is no longer entirely in the ground.
 - Fixed issue with wooden barricades (like the one in Raven Rock Mine) being unbreakable.
 - Hopefully fixed a bug where Xelzaz would reequip his scarf when the player fast-travelled.
 - Fixed an issue where Totem of the Skull was giving too much cooldown reduction for howls.
 - Fixed an issue where Call of the Blood was giving too much cooldown reduction for howls.
 - Fixed an issue with the Hircine’s Rage perk.
 - Fixed an issue with the tooltip for the animal Vigor perk.
 - Fixed an issue with the tooltip for the Animal Vitality perk.
 - Fixed an issue where the unarmed bonus for non-beast races who become Werewolves was not functioning properly.
 - You will now be able to earn the Steam achievement for mastering Werewolf when you learn all 22 Werewolf perks in Manbeast.
 - Fixed Dragon Storm Call shouts (and similar variants) ignoring resistances.
 - (Hopefully) Fixed the issue with Wyrmstooth's Barrow of the Wyrm quest not initializing correctly.

### Consistency Tweaks

 - `fxfirecloak01.nif` now uses correct Embers XD textures.
 - Swapped Morokei's mask to the Elven Gold retexture.
 - Eversnow is now properly treated as contraband.
 - Bruma's Imperial City LODs should be fixed now.
 - Animal Senses can now be toggled on and off with a re-press of the power button. This applies to the Detect Life element as well.
 - Hunter’s Sight can now be toggled on and off with a re-press of the power button. This applies to the Detect Life element as well.
 - Added a condition to Jala's "You look like you could do with a ripe apple. Or a tomato, cabbage, or leek?", so she says that only while working at the stall.
 - Changed dialogue with Lynly so the player asks her if she likes playing the lute instead of asking what she plays, because she starts the conversation by saying that
 - Fixed some conditions on Romlyn's dialogue.

## 1.4.4

Key Info

 - Save Safe, ignore the one missing plugin.
 - Regenerated SynNPCFixes.
 - Removed NPC hatred if the player practices necromancy. This change will not automatically take effect on existing save games.
 - Moved some mods that adjust difficulty to the Optional Tweaks section so they are easier to toggle for players who want to.
 - This is probably the last update before the next major update.

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>

### Balancing Changes

 - Reworked item values and enchant charges for every item in [Baited](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99023), [Artifacts of the Ancestors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92389), and [Madness and Order](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99144).
 - Reworked Master Necromancer Robes and Hood effect and made the +1 zombie bonus a set bonus.

### Bug Fixes
 
 - (Hopefully) fixed texture mapping issues on Werewolves.
 - Fixed Xander's Hair Texture, for real this time, I think.
 - Fixed missing textures on male version of Lord's Mail. I'm not sure why it was missing textures in the previous version, but it's fixed now.
 - Summon Durnehviir will now be auto-unlocked when he teaches you the words. This was an intended feature that was not working last update. This change will not apply to existing save games.

### Consistency Tweaks

 - NPCs no longer hate you if you are a necromancer. This is mostly done because necromancer is already a very annoying build to play and it felt like the NPC hate made it even more tedious of a build when it is not really meta. Use the console command `set Reactions_Guard to 2` to apply this change to an existing save game.
 - Soreke (Chef in Fort Dawnguard) now has a more appropriate inventory stock.

<Details>
<summary>Patch Notes</summary>
 
### Balancing Changes

 - Disabled [Scrambled Bugs'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532) Follower (`teammates`) and Commanded Actor (`commandedActors`) difficulty mulitplier patch (`difficultyMultipliers`) as it overly punished conjuration builds and made followers much weaker than intended.
 - Removed Wildfire, Deep Freeze, and Power Surge from non-boss NPCs. This change was made to reduce the amount of times the player could be one-shot from 50%.
 - Removed Curse Binging and Rank 2 of Chaos Binding from NPCs. This change was made to reduce the occassional one-shots that could be experienced against bound weapon wielding enemies, especially due to how inconsistent they could occur, while also aimed to bring the damage these enemies deal more in line with other enemy sub-types. 
 - Dragon Rising and Bleak Falls Barrow now give perk points on completion, bringing total number of perk points to be acquired from quests to 25.
 - Adjusted Vampire Hours from 7pm to 5am to 7pm to 6am.
 - Reduced value of Brawler's Gauntlets. Next major update I am going to look into reworking their function.

 - Removed custom texture set from Hearthfire's Potato Bread and BS Bruma's Rice Bread.
 - Fixed texture set not applying on Bruma Butter and Hearthfire Butter.
 - Fixed missing textures on `markarthdwarftower02cwsnow.nif`.
 - Fixed Mulush gro-Shugurz's facegen.
 - Fixed Ma'randru-jo's facegen.
 - Fixed Lob's facegen mesh.
 - Fixed invalid FormID in Children of the Pariah.
 - "Suprise me." dialogue option will no longer start every available bounty quest instead of a random one.
 - Potential fix for CTD that sometimes occurred when starting every available bounty quest at once. 
 - Fixed Katana's scene not triggering in the Frozen Hearth.
 - Fixed an issue with River in the final fight in the Chasing the Current quest (Katana).
 - Added missing temper recipes for Companion's Armor (set).
 - Corrected armor rating on Companion's Armor (chest piece).
 - Blacklisted beafarmer apiaries from Seasons. This should fix the messed up shader that they were experiencing.
 - Added missing `dynamic1pxcubemap_black.dds` needed to make Dynamic Cubemaps function properly with newest ENB Binaries.
 - Fixed filepath typo in `Praedy's College of Winterhold - Patches and Addons` for `WinterHoldWindowMetal_EM.dds` and `WinterHoldWindowMetal_N.dds`
 - Removed a Nirnroot in the Whiterun tundra that was inside of a structure, causing it to be unobtainable.
 - Fixed issue where Bound Bow's flame effect stopped animating for the remaining duration after you fired the bow once.
 
### Consistency Fixes
 
 - Recolored torch wood.
 - Hid some textures that were overwriting KS Salt and Wind retexture, causing some hairs to have the incorrect texture.
 - Reworked Flame, Shock, and Frost Cloak and Stendarr's Aura visuals to be less blinding in first person.
 - Nordic Grates now have more consistent/realistic collision.
 - Added `MagicDisallowEnchanting` keyword to Companion's Armor (set) for consistency with other guilde armors.
 - Khajiit Ohmes race now uses Bosmer skeleton.
 - Khajiit Dagi-Raht and Cathay races now use Khajiit skeleton.

## 1.4.1

Info

 - Should be save safe, just ignore the missing plugins.
    - If you have already been in the Riverwood Trader then it might be a little awkward, but it shouldn't cause any issues with the save game.
 - Changed Fire setup.
 - Added Bodyslide support for Armor of Yngol.
 - Deleted some old outputs from the downloads folder that were bloating the installation size.
 - __Balancing Notes:__
    - Changed Ring of the Erudite's Enchant to "Your Magicka Regenerates 100% faster".
    - Changed Ring of the Beast's Enchant to "Your Health is increased by 50, and your unarmed attacks deal 25% extra damage."
    > Developer Note: These two changes are to bring these two items more in line with other choices so they do not become defacto "best-in-slot" choices while they have yet to be reworked officially within SimonRim.
    - Removed Throat of the World spell from Morokei and Krosis.
    - Wood Elf Vampire Bonus now gives +50% Poison Use instead of +1 poison uses.
    - Wood Elf Vampire Bonus now gives +50% Alchemy duration instead of 1.5x Alchemy duration.
    - Imperial Vampire Bonus now gives +50% Illusion duration instead of 1.5x Illusion duration.
    - Dark Elf Vampire bonus now gives +25% extra sneak attack damage and sneaking instead of 1.25x sneak attack damage.
    - Ice Blade of the Monarch has a new enchantment: "Deals 20 Frost damage to Health and Stamina, and leaves behind a hazard that deals extra damage over 10 seconds. Reduces enemy Frost Resistance by 50% for 30 seconds."
    > Developer Note: This change was made to differentiate the Ice Blade of the Monarch more from Chillrend.
    - Fists of Randagulf no longer give the incorrect +25 Unarmed damage, but instead +25% Unarmed damage.
    - Fighter's Stance, Warrior's Stance, and Brawler's Stance have been buffed up to +50% Power Attack damage from +25% Power Attack damage.
    - Sorcerer Class now gives 15% Spell Absorb instead of 10%. This change will **not** take affect on existing save games unless you remove and re-add the class.
 - __Bug Fixes__:
    - Fixed Destructive Barrier being unatainable due to perk requirement error.
    - Fixed Relentless perk unintentionally showing up in Active Magic Effects.
    - Mehrunes Dagon's resistance shred will no longer be absorbed by NPCs (not really a "bug" but the visual spam is annoying).
    - Fixed bug where Thaumaturgy's scaler perk was being applied to the player record twice, causing self-made enchantments to be a lower potency that intended.
    - Removed the debug notification that occured when using the Froststar weapon or an item with the same enchant.

    - Reduced Alik'r Prisoner fine to 4,000 septims (down from 10,000 septims).
    - Removed Enchanted gear reward from "In My Time Of Need" Quest if you side with Kematu.
    > **Developer Note**: The two changes above will hopefully make the decision that is made in the quest more reasonable from a gameplay POV, bringing down the fine to a more reasonable amount and making it so that you can only get the enchanted set of items by killing Kematu, should provide a reason to side with Saadia.

    - Forsworn now have a 25% malus to their Magic Resistance.
    - Forsworn Spell Absorption bonus nerfed from 10% to 5%.
    > **Developer Note**: These Forsworn nerfs are primarily meant to offset the fact that Forsworn were double dipping their unique bonus with Breton's racial bonus.
    - Harkon's gear is changed to light armor.
    > **Developer Note**: This change is meant to gain consistency with Artificer's unique Vampire Royal Armor that was given to Harkon in order to provide more competitive unique item choices for Light Armor spellswords.
    - Reworked unique items in the Midden.
    - Boosted midden encounter zone level from 10 to 15.
    - Removed Draugr Taunt Idle.
    - Changed the bonuses and enchants on some of the unique items in Fahluaan.
    - Windcaller equipment moved to a chest at Throat of the World until I figure out a better implementation.
    - Reworked Bounty rewards again.

 - __Bug Fixes:__ 
    - Fixed issue where entering Quicksilver Mine caused the player to get stuck in a void.
    - Fixed the selected options in Two-Handed and Ranged subtypes not being saved in Skyrim Unbound start.
    - Fixed first person Katana animation being used under the incorrect conditions.

## 1.3.0

Info
 
 - Conflict check over the entire list, cleaned up (a lot of) errors.
 - Unslaad 3.0 Update.
 - Seasons of Skyrim Added.
 - Added Journeyman back as an opt-in mod.
 - Regenerated Sorcerer and Khajiit Speak patches.
 - Fixed Night Eye (maybe).
 - Fixed body texture misalignment on beast races.
 - Fixed Hagraven Clutter missing textures.
 - Fixed issue where Helm of the Deep Diver wasn't appropriately patched for Open Face Helmets.

 - Changed the bonus for the Paradise set.
 - Followers no longer affect the stealth meter.
 - Slightly rebalanced economy.
 - Added the Unbound Room to the Oblivion Cell formlist so survival needs shouldn't progress until you leave.
 - Bow speeds are now standardized (most were previously, but all should be covered now). Unique items with faster draw (like Zephyr) are excluded.
 - Nerfed scroll crafting xp.
 - Adjusted overall XP curve for some skills.
 - Bound Weapons now give Conjuration experience when used. This is to compensate for how slowly bound weapon builds level if they are not using summons to supplement their conjuration leveling.
 - Unique sets can be recrafted as unenchanted gear if you have the appropriate perks and the cuirass of the set in your inventory.
 - Fixed spears using battleaxe animations instead of spear animations.

 - Cleaned out some unused downloads from early development.

 - Fixed invisible meshes on some unique items (this might have only been a pre-release issue).
 - The Spell Absorb visual was removed, due to more enemy types having spell absorb now and the visual being very annoying and triggering too often in some cases. The player will still be alerted that enemies "resisted" a spell when absorption occurs.
 - Player is no longer randomly assigned an OBody preset in racemenu.

## 1.2.4

Sorry, ***this** is the last update. Save in an interior before updating. For those who do not want to upload again, just download the new DynDOLOD and Occlusion Output files on the nexus page [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87820?tab=files) and overwrite the existing `Fahluaan - DynDOLOD Output` and `Fahluaan - Occlusion Output` mods.

 - Fixed a lod issue.
 - Styyx also fixed his mod which will hopefully fix some quest rewards I had previously setup, unfortunately this can't be applied retroactively to existing saves, but I promise you aren't missing out on much.
 - Reduced the number of favor quests needed to get thaneship. To fix this on existing games, use the following console commands `set FriendsTotalMajorHold to 10` and `set FriendsTotalMinorHold to 5`

<Details>

### Updated
 
 - DynDOLOD 3 Alpha
 - DynDOLOD DLL NG

</Details>

## 1.2.3

Save Safe.

 - I'll be away and unable to update the 8-14th, sorry for so many updates these past few days LOL.
 - New Unique set (Rakazra).
 - Removed errant enchants from some Moon Monk gear.
 - Buffed Ravager's Axe (unique item).
 - Rebalanced the Merchant perk in the Speech tree.
 - Changed Fighter's Stance, Warrior's Stance, and Brawler's Stance to be one rank perks. This should appropriately tune some power attack damage for both the player and NPCs.
 - Kematu now gives you the enchanted Remnant set if you side with him. You no longer have to kill him to get the armor.
 - Fixed a ton of tooltips on unique sets.
 - Fixed the Distinct Interior _SWAP.ini so it now properly swaps the statics with lootable items.
 - Reverted CoMAP's dll to version 3.4.2.

### Updated
 
 - Starfrost - A Survival Overhaul

</Details>

## 1.2.0

### Info

Probably not save-safe. 90% not save-safe.

 - Survival Mode is enabled by default now. I decided to do this because it lets me have the more "hardcore" mechanics I want enabled by default while being easy to "opt-out" of instead of the intended experience for the list being "opt-in". Please read more about Survival Mode changes on the [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536) mod page as it is very different from base Survival.
 - Bingus made me do graphic stuff again.
 - Fixed Sunder's mesh *again*.
 - Tweaked Precision settings.
 - Removed CC Goblins, CC Plague of the Dead, and CC Bone Wolf.
 - Fixed Khajiit Racial not applying the Shock Resistance.

## 1.1.0

### Info

According to Simon this should be **Save Safe**. **Save in an interior before updating if you plan on continuing an existing save.**

 - Bingus made me do some graphic stuff. File size may have gone up or down, I have no idea.
 - Added Starfrost and Candlehearth to (I think) complete the Survival Lite suite. Survival is still optional, but it's much more in line with what I want from survival now.
 - Do not update while you have any rested buff.
 - While this update is save safe, if you aren't too far into your playthrough, I would restart just for safety.
 - Wheeler keybinds have been fixed a bit.
 - Wheeler now uses the same font as the rest of the main UI (Sanguis).
  - Changed Wheeler Menu controller keybinds to not default to Left Trigger, I still suggest playing around with these as a controller player since I do not have a controller and do not really know what works well for them.
    - Right Thumb to open in inventory, no bind to open outside of inventory.
    - DPAD Right/Left to move between items.
    - Check dMenu (`Home` to open) for the rest of the binds.
 - Fixed purple lods caused by IMR.
 - Sunder appropriately sheathes like a mace now.
 - Regenerated Khajiit Speak patch.

## 0.3.2

### Info

Some rapid fire fixes

 - Corrected a mistake in the uncapper.
 - Fixed Gamepad file so it should hopefully just work without issue. . .maybe.

## 0.3.1

### Info

I only really made this version differentiation because it is genuinely easier for me to keep the changelog this way due to a large break in time.

 - Katanas (one-handed) now benefit from War-Axe perks, rather than sword perks.
 - Spears (two-handed) now benefit from Battleaxe perks, rather than greatsword perks.
 - Quarterstaves no longer exist.
 - Spears are integrated, Katanas will likely be somewhat more integrated in the future (depends on whether or not more suitable animations exist).
 - Halberds will be less common.
 - Fixed issues with sheathed Locomotion.
 - Cleaned up old/redundant download files.
 - Returned the ability to move dead NPCs.
 - Potentially fixed Bloodskal Blade.
 - Removed Perk Point rewards from Vigilant quests since Karma already exists.
 - Transitioned to a Vanilla-Styled leveling system, feedback is appreciated as I was only able to test early game.
 - Increased interior brightness by a little.
 - Added the 9 Shrines of the Divines to the Skyrim Unbound starting room.
 - Potential fix for Poison-related crashes thanks to Dareni and Simon.
 - I probably broke Gamepads again this update.

 - Draugr can no longer be damaged when "awakening" from their slumber.
 - Fixed issue with unarmed sprint.
 - Patched Meridia Shrine in Vigilant to give the proper buff.
 - Gave Athis and Torvar some much needed equipment upgrades.
 - Added more NPCs to RSV Exclusion.

    - Reason: I hate you all. Stop complaining now.
 - Phylogeny - Races of Tamriel
    - Reason: Swapped Race overhauls for sake of better integration.
 - Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim
    - Reason: I felt a lot of the spells were feature overlaps or very unbalanced compared to other spells in the list. As a result I decided that it would be a good long term decision for my sanity and for my vision of the list to take it out. It's possible a very modified version of some Apocalypse spells may come back in the future, but as of now the mod will remain removed.

       - Carved Brink - Modpocalypse
       - Carved Brink - High Poly NPCs

    - Reason: No one really used the mod, sometimes it caused a weird interaction with the "Performing Badly" mgef. Decided it should be cut.
 - Ghosts of the Tribunal - Voiced Narrative (Creation Club)
    - Reason: Redundant Mod.
 - HD Reworked Pelts
