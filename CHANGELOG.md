# Changelog

- [0.2.0](#020)
- [0.1.0-RC2](#010-rc2)
- [0.1.0-RC1](#010-rc1)

## 0.2.0

### Info

 - This update may be save safe, but if you are continuing a save you might encounter some oddities.
    - If you are continuing a save, **please save in an interior and backup your saves**.
 - Fixed potion inventory sizes.
 - Fixed an oversight with God-King Soul Reaver's Weapon.
 - Fixed neck gaps with certain named Khajiit. 
 - Fixed(?) Controlmap setup for Gamepad.
 - Fixed Muiri's missing texture.
 - Fixed face issue with Kematu, Kleppr, and Arniel Gane. I can't catch all of these so please report any fucked up faces.
 - ENB Tweaks.
 - Fixed incorrect shader effect for flesh spells.
 - Fixed Rested and Well Rested Bonuses to no longer give "Fortify Skill Rate" buffs (since it was useless).
 - Fixed Whiterun Roof Parallax.
 - Fixed Fire mismatch.
 - Reduced Snow Brightness.
 - Fixed alternate texture set on CC baskets.
 - Changed "Momentum" to "Bob and Weave" in the Hand to Hand tree.
 - Fixed* CC Quests initiating when they shouldn't. If there are any I missed please let me know.
 - Blacklisted an OBody preset that wasn't meant to be in distribution.
 - Increased number of Skyshards needed per perk point from 3 --> 4.
    - This is compensated by more perks being available from certain quests.
 - Complete overhaul of the DAR structure and setup. This comes with many fixes but also meant that the experimental 1st person setup will be delayed a little longer than I intended.
 - Removed Step Dodge on Light Armor/Unarmored. All Dodges are now roll dodges.
 - Removed Weapon Arts.
 - Removed some errant MagicDisallowEnchanting flags from armor that should be enchantable.
 - Removed Camera Shake*.
