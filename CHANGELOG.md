### Info

Some rapid fire fixes

## 0.3.1

I only really made this version differentiation because it is genuinely easier for me to keep the changelog this way due to a large break in time.

 - Katanas (one-handed) now benefit from War-Axe perks, rather than sword perks.
 - Spears (two-handed) now benefit from Battleaxe perks, rather than greatsword perks.
 - Quarterstaves no longer exist.
 - Spears are integrated, Katanas will likely be somewhat more integrated in the future (depends on whether or not more suitable animations exist).
 - Halberds will be less common.
 - Fixed issues with sheathed Locomotion.
 - Cleaned up old/redundant download files.
 - Returned the ability to move dead NPCs.
 - Potentially fixed Bloodskal Blade.
 - Removed Perk Point rewards from Vigilant quests since Karma already exists.
 - Transitioned to a Vanilla-Styled leveling system, feedback is appreciated as I was only able to test early game.
 - Increased interior brightness by a little.
 - Added the 9 Shrines of the Divines to the Skyrim Unbound starting room.
 - Potential fix for Poison-related crashes thanks to Dareni and Simon.

 - Inconvenient Dungeons
    - Reason: I hate you all. Stop complaining now.
 - Phylogeny - Races of Tamriel
    - Reason: Swapped Race overhauls for sake of better integration.
 - Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim
    - Reason: I felt a lot of the spells were feature overlaps or very unbalanced compared to other spells in the list. As a result I decided that it would be a good long term decision for my sanity and for my vision of the list to take it out. It's possible a very modified version of some Apocalypse spells may come back in the future, but as of now the mod will remain removed.
 - Moon And Star
    - Reason: Was a pain to upkeep the patches for it and the content it added felt a little dated.
       - Lucien - Moon and Star Patch
       - Ryn's Standing Stones Moon and Star Patch
       - Moon and Star - Cleaned Plugin Replacer
       - Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods - MAS Patch
       - Modpocalypse Moon and Star
 - All Thieves Guild Jobs Concurrently
    - Reason: Was already included in TNOTT.
 - Epic Doors of Whiterun
    - Reason: included in GDOS Update.
 - Hype's Farmhouse Door
    - Reason: included in GDOS Update.
 - Warmonger Armory Tweaks - Loremonger Edition
    - Reason: Didn't need it anymore.
        - Warmonger Armory OWL Patch
 - Ryn's Robber's Gorge
    - Reason: Performance for this mod was sadly too poor to keep it in the list, regardless of how cool the area was.
 - Ryn's Halted Stream Camp
    - Reason: Performance for this mod was sadly too poor to keep it in the list, regardless of how cool the area was.
 - Carved Brink 
    - Reason: Bad mod/kinda buggy.
       - Carved Brink - Modpocalypse
       - Carved Brink - High Poly NPCs
 - Skyrim's Got Talent - Improve as a Bard
    - Reason: No one really used the mod, sometimes it caused a weird interaction with the "Performing Badly" mgef. Decided it should be cut.
 - Ghosts of the Tribunal - Voiced Narrative (Creation Club)
    - Reason: Redundant Mod.
 - HD Reworked Pelts
    - Reason: Performance overhead.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Solitude
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Morthal
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Winterhold
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Whiterun
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Riften
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Windhelm
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Dibella's Blessing - Markarth
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Ultimate Combat
    - Reason: Old mod, had certain issues, and the features utilized from the mod (specifically creature special attacks, etc) could be redone using DAR.
 - Realistic Dark Brotherhood Kidnapping
    - Reason: Seemed unnecessary.
 - VIGILANT - HiRes Pack 01
    - Reason: Mod updated.
 - VIGILANT - HiRes Pack 02
    - Reason: Mod updated.
 - Armor Rating Redux SE
    - Reason: Blade and Blunt now handles Armor Rating scaling.
 - Adamant - Talos Tweaks
    - Reason: Integrated in Pilgrim.
 - Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim
    - Reason: Pilgrim's perk implementation of Blessings, as well as misc other features made me want to swap Religion mods. Also Pilgrim is just generally better implemented into the list in terms of blessing balance.

       - Poisebreaker Perks For Adamant H2H
       - Poise Staggerlock Prevention
       - aljo's POISE .toml
 - Sales Overflow Solved
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Elven Chainmail
    - Reason: Armor wasn't well integrated.
 - Enhanced Skyrim Factions - The Companions Guild
    - Reason: Mod had some issues saving proper MCM settings and people complained too much. Exchanged it for the 2 new mods in Added.
 - Frankly HD Masque of Clavicus Vile
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - I'm Walkin' Here
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
 - Whose Quest is it Anyway
    - Reason: Redundant mod.
